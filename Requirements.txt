7. REST API - With the help of DRF please create a listing of products api, and login/signup with simple jwt token. 
   You can create a json response as you like.
8. Again I am not looking for HTML/CSS at all, If Iâ€™m logged in as a customer I should be able to see the list of product that has been added by owner and
   if I am logged in as owner than I should  be able to see the product that are added by me and I can add new product.
